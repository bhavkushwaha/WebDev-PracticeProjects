# Dicee-Game
Whenever you hit play, the page refreshes and given a winner.
If the player 1 rolls more than player 2, he/she wins and vice versa.
At times both the dice can show the same number resulting in a draw.
You can even reset the page to default setting.
This Webite can be used as a game to settle small disputes as the result is completely random everytime.
